<h2>General features</h2>
<h3>The Directory Player</h3>
<p>
1by1 is a small and versatile audio player for MP3, MP2 and plugin supported audio formats
as WAV, OGG, AAC, CD Audio and many others. With no need for playlists it simply plays your tracks,
one by one directly from your directories.
</p><p>
The player focuses on smart file handling and enhanced play features. You won't find
visual effects or skins. On the other hand you get extra features like built in dynamic audio
enhancing, transition mixing, a file finder, big title display, Cue sheet and Playlist support.
</p><p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> In individual cases you may need/want additional files: For systems without an MP3 <i>ACM decoder</i>
(present since Windows XP) you can use the <i>mpglib.dll</i> which also decodes MP2. For lots of other file formats
you can add the <i>BASS library</i> or <i>plugin files</i>.
More details in the <a href="#aud">Configuration</a> section.
</p>
<h3>General usage</h3>
<p>
With this player you directly browse through your folders using a tree and a file list.
The main functions are on a button bar, and there are <b>four menus</b> which all can be
reached by the right mouse button. Right clicking into the button field (or <b> F1</b>) shows
the <b>main menu</b>, where you can reach the <b>options menu</b> and the Favorites.
<b>Context menus</b> for tree and list items can be reached by right clicking on the items.
</p>
<h3>Resume Play and Auto Resume</h3>
<p>
The <b>Resume</b> function is more than a simple pause button. It remembers the played file and
the position - even when the program was closed. To resume (or unpause) a track, press the
<b>Stop/Play</b> button. The <b>Auto Resume</b> feature allows to resume a track
immediately after 1by1 has started. It is called by setting the /r option in the command line
(e.g. in the command line of a desktop shortcut for 1by1). Details in the command line section.
</p>
<h3>Favorites</h3>
<p>
You can store up to 30 favorite tracks, folders, Cue sheets or playlists.
They are shown in the <b>Main/Favorites menu</b> which appears by pressing <b>F1</b> or the
<b>right mouse button</b> in the control button area. Local folders and lists are also shown
under the Favorites tree item. <b>Network folders</b> may not appear there, to reach them use
Main/Favorites menu. There are three ways to <b>add a Favorite:</b> 1. from the track context menu
you can add the selected track, 2. the tree context menu allows adding a folder/list, and 3. in the
Main menu you can add the current track including the current position.
</p>
<h3>Uninstall</h3>
<p>
To remove 1by1 from your system, simply delete the program folder and the
shortcuts. The program does not create any registry entries.
1by1 tries to store its <i>ini-File</i> in the program folder. If you don't have
write access there, the settings are stored in the folder <i>1by1</i> in the
application data section of the user profile. To remove it from there, you can
press the <i>Uninstall...</i> button in the System section of 1by1's settings.
</p>

<a id="mov"></a>
<h2>Track handling</h2>
<h3>Moving and skipping tracks in the list</h3>
<p>
With the <b>Next</b> button you can move selected tracks to the position after the
current track. To exclude a track from being played, press the <b>Skip</b> button,
which never deletes any file but only removes it from the currently shown list.
Tracks can also be dragged with the mouse or moved up and down with the keys
<b>Shift+(Page) Up/Down</b>. On changing or reloading the folder, any exclusions
or position changes will be forgotten. 
</p><p>
<b>Tip:</b> If you want the player to continue after the currently playing file at another position
in the same list, simply skip the current track and select the next track to be played.
</p>
<h3>Sort and shuffle files</h3>
<p>
You can sort your file list with the tab buttons. The current mode is indicated in the tab with
the direction (+) or (-). <b>Shuffle</b> (random file listing) is enabled by the <b>Shuffle button</b>
in the button bar. To shuffle again press the same button. To leave the Shuffle mode, press one
of the sort buttons. Jumping into random directories is not possible. If you want to play
a <b>whole path shuffled</b>, it is recommended to use the file finder (see below).
</p>
<h3>Repeat modes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regular play
<li>Repeat all tracks (of the folder or the whole drive - depending on "Auto search dirs" set)
<li>Repeat the current track (works not with Cue sheets)
<li>Play only one file (works not with Cue sheets)
</ul>
<h3>Dropping files</h3>
<p>
A single file or a group of files can be dropped - with different effects:
<ul>
<li>Drop to file list or playlist: Insert track(s) to list
<li>Drop to folder tree: jump to folder and start track (old behaviour for dropping anywhere)
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Intro scan</h3>
<p>
Gives you a fast audible overview of the tracks in the current list. Open the Intro scan view
from the <b>main menu</b> or with <b>Ctrl+N</b>. It starts from the first or the selected track and
works even with Cue sheets. Scanning multiple folders is not possible. The start position
and the preview duration can be set with the sliders. While Intro scan is running you have full
access to the rest of 1by1, allowing e.g. to enqueue files to the playlist view.
</p>
<h3>(Auto) insert</h3>
<p>
This special feature allows automated and manual inserting of tracks from another folder to the current list.
Open the additional window either for search results from the <b>search dialog</b> or for a folder content
from the <b>tree context menu</b>.
You can manually add tracks to the current list by the <b>Insert</b> button, double click or by dragging.
</p><p>
Automatic insert will be done after the time, which can be adjusted between 1 and 90 minutes. The next or the
first file of the list will be inserted. On automated insertion only one file can be put to a position, before and
after it there must be a regular list entry. The insert timer is always active when the window is open.
</p>

<a id="lis"></a>
<h2>Find and list</h2>
<h3>Directory finder</h3>
<p>
1by1 can scan for folders with known file types, playlists and Cue sheets. The sequence
of found lists depends on the folder depth and the alphabetical order. 
</p><p>
To search a folder forward or backwards, press the <b>Find previous/next folder</b> button.
If "<b>Auto search dirs</b>" is enabled, 1by1 will search the next folder when it reaches the end of
the current. If you don't want to scan for playlists and Cue sheets (e.g. to prevent files from being
played twice), check the "<b>Search skips playlists/Cue sheets</b>" option in the control settings.
</p>
<h3>File finder</h3>
<p>
By <b>F3 or the tree context menu</b> you can call the file finder for the current or the selected folder.
<b>Shift+F3 or the optional toolbar button</b> calls the file finder for the current drive.
The finder searches (always including subfolders) for files with currently supported types. You
can enter a search string (e.g. part of a track name or an extension), a date range, a size range or a
combination of all (AND combined). A running search can be interrupted by pressing the Esc key.
</p><p>
The preset buttons for time and size allow to set some basic search patterns, for e.g. newest files
or files with size limitations, by simple clicks without entering numbers. The button
"<b>To insert view</b>" opens the <i>Insert window</i> and puts the search results there instead
of the normal file list. To list all (supported) files within a path, press Search with nothing entered.
Scanning all drives at once is not possible.
</p>
<h3>Playlists and Cue Sheets</h3>
<p>
Playlists (*.m3u) and Cue Sheets (*.cue) appear <b>like folders</b> in the tree.
<b>Playlists</b> can be shown in their original order, sorted by filename or path or be shuffled.
<b>Cue sheets</b> are used to display large files (e.g. CD images) with track indices
and titles. A Cue sheet can only be played in the given order.
</p><p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> Cue sheets used together with <b>VBR files</b> will usually create incorrect cue
positions. 1by1 can locate the exact cue positions in VBR files: check the option <i>"Scan Cue sheet
positions on VBR files"</i>. While scanning the VBR file for the cues, the program may freeze some seconds.
</p>
<h3>Playlist View</h3>
<p>
A second list can be opened to compile playlists from different folders. Use the
<b>Playlist button</b> in the toolbar (or Shift+F5) to switch it on or off. If you quit 1by1 or close
the list, the content will be saved.
</p><p>
To add files, simply <b>drag</b> them from the file list or press <b>Ctrl+Return</b>
or choose "<b>Enqueue</b>" from the file context menu. You can also enqueue a file at the command
line by starting 1by1 with the option <i>/enqueue</i> (see Command line options).
Also from the explorer files can be dragged into the playlist view for enqueuing.
</p><p>
For adding existing <b>Playlists (*.m3u)</b> to the playlist view, copy the whole list from the
normal view to the playlist view by selecting all (Ctrl+A). If the file of a playlist entry does not exist,
it will not be copied to the playlist view.
</p><p>
To <b>export</b> any list or selection to a playlist file, open the context menu for one or more files
and select "<b>Save/append ... to playlist</b>". This works even in the normal file view.
</p>
</p>
<h3>Status bar</h3>
<p>
The status bar on the bottom gives information of folder summary, track type and decoder,
and on the right side some informations about program settings in short form. These are the meanings:

<h2>Audio configuration</h2>
<h3>Settings window</h3>
<p>
The Settings dialog can be reached with the <b>Settings button</b>, by pressing <b>F6</b> or Ctrl+S.
</p>
<h3>Supported MPEG audio decoders</h3>
<p>
<b>ACM Codec</b>: recommended for mp3 decoding.
Decodes Layer 3 only. It must be installed in the system.
</p><p>
<b>mpglib.dll</b>: alternative decoder with good sound quality but little more cpu usage. Must be in
1by1's folder or the "path". Version 0.92 decodes Layers 3 and 2. It is available at 1by1's homepage.
</p>
<h3>BASS Support</h3>
<p>
The BASS decoding library can be used to play lots of file formats. By itself it decodes mp1-mp3, ogg, wav,
aif and many tracker formats. Extended by plugins/add-ons it plays also aac, midi, CD-Audio, flac
and more.
</p><p>
<b>Usage:</b> Download the bass.dll (major version 2.4) and optionally some add-ons from the Un4seen
homepage. Copy the <b>DLL file(s) (32 bit versions, NOT 64 bit!)</b> into the 1by1 program folder.
The Midi add-on also needs a Soundfont file in the program folder (first found is used).
After adding the library, all supported file types are shown in the file and play lists.
The "pure" 1by1 only shows mp3 and mp2.
</p><p>
As BASS also allows <b>netstreaming</b>, 1by1 shows URLs in m3u playlists in the Path column.
To have also a "friendly name" of a radio station, the playlist should contain an extended info line before
each address line (Format: "#EXTINF:-1,station name"). For more info check m3u format refererences or
download the Webradio m3u example from the 1by1 homepage.
You can also <b>download</b> a playing netstream: Right click on the destination folder
in the tree and select <i>Save download stream here...</i> 
</p>
<h3>Winamp Input Plugin Support</h3>
<p>
1by1 can also use Winamp 2.x input plugins for decoding different formats (no Unicode filenames).
<b>Usage:</b> put the needed plugin <b>DLL files</b> (in_*.dll) into your 1by1 directory.
</p><p>
The plugin support is not 100% and the several plugins may behave differently.
<u>These plugins are successfully tested:</u>
<b>in_wave</b> (2.0+2.06),
<b>in_vorbis</b> (1.13a, 1.2b19+1.32; on seek problems set the plugin priority to "normal", see FAQ),
<b>in_CDReader</b> (1.95),
<b>in_mp3</b> (2.75j, 2.81b, 2.91; problems with seek on VBR files with no "TOC" in the header),
<b>in_mp3pro</b> (1.1),
<b>in_mod</b> (2.2.10b29),
<b>in_mad</b> (0.14.2b, 0.15.1b; problems with seek on CBR files; 24/32 bit output successfully tested),
<b>in_mp4</b> (2.1b; buffer size must be divisible by 4!),
<b>in_flac</b> (1.1.4).
<u>At least playing a file:</u>
<b>in_mpp</b> (1.7.9f), <b>in_mod</b> (1.3), <b>in_snes</b> (3.2), <b>in_sid</b> (1.4b).
</p><p>
Plugins which don't use the wave output are also supported. 
But note that waveout features like <b>volume control, gapless or audio enhancer</b> are not working
with (the non-waveout mode of) these plugins. <u>Successfully tested:</u>
<b>in_midi</b> (3.01, 3.07; mode "DirectMusic with output" uses few buffers caused by realtime/midi input),
<b>in_cdda</b> (2.90a).
</p>
</p><p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> Plugin support is outdated. It's highly recommended to use the BASS library and BASS add-ons prior to
Winamp plugins. Since 1by1 supports only Winamp 2.x plugins, this works not with unicode filenames which are used
by several languages. Also problems on play and long tracks may occur.
</p>
<h3>Audio settings</h3>
<p>
<b>Maximum wave buffer:</b> Maximum size of a single wave buffer. The default value is 32 KB.
Enlarge it if a longer buffer time is needed, e.g. for Overlap or on low resources (play interruptions).
You can also try to vary this value if the output is disturbed by periodical clicks.
</p><p>
<b>Number of buffers:</b> Default is 8. Increase if a longer buffer time is needed, e.g. for Overlap
or on low resources (play interruptions). Values below 4 are not recommended.
</p><p>
<b>Buffer length:</b> The time in seconds is the buffer setting method for Direct Sound mode.
</p><p>
<b>Gapless output:</b>
This option allows continuous audio output between tracks. E.g. when playing a CD with the
CDReader plugin or MP3 files with the encoder delay value set in the Lame header,
the transitions of mixed tracks will not be interrupted. Gapless enables the additional options
Silence skip and Overlap.
</p><p>
<b>Use with plugins:</b> Means that the gapless feature will be used for plugin played files, too. In some
cases gapless play with plugins may be faulty. So the feature can be disabled seperately for plugins.
</p><p>
<b>Skip silences:</b> If enabled, parts below -55 dB will be shortened. This function also improves the
Overlap feature on tracks with pauses at the beginning or the end.
</p><p>
<b>Overlap:</b> Allows mixed track transitions. Disabled by default. As the maximum mixing time
depends on the total wave buffer size, you need <b>large buffer settings</b>, e.g. 20 buffers with a
size of 64 KB. With the <b>Threshold</b> value you can adjust the level of the ending track at which
the new track will be started and mixed over. The default value is -9 dB.
</p><p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> All gapless functions work only if the samplerate and the stereo mode don't
change. This means: A song with 44.1 kHz and another one with 48 kHz cannot be played gapless.
<b>Overlap</b> works only with ACM or mpglib - not with plugins.
</p><p>
<b>Auto space:</b> Waits the entered time (in milliseconds) before
starting the next track. Maximum is 10 seconds. Disables the Gapless output. Disabled by default.
</p><p>
<b>Reverse balance (internal):</b> Even 1by1 has no balance adjustment, it can store it if set somewhere
else (e.g. in the Windows mixer). And some sound devices need a swapped balance. Only for these
cases this option may be useful.
</p><p>
<b>Alt. volume setting:</b> If the sound driver does not support Windows' volume setting, this
option can be used to calculate the volume internally. Disabled by default. Only working on 16 bit output.
</p>
<h3>Built in audio enhancer and stereo wider</h3>
<p>
The DSP gets rid of tracks in different volumes. Depending on the settings and the audio material it can
also drastically enhance the sound of tracks which already have full level. Note: The enhancer works
<b>only with 16 bit</b> output (mono or stereo).
</p><p>
<b>Max amp:</b> Maximum amplification (up to 20 dB = 10x)
</p><p>
<b>Amp raise:</b> Time the enhancer tends towards the maximum amplification level. Faster raise will
enhance more but can also cause more distortions on some input material. To keep the sound of
dynamic music natural choose longer values (500 ms or more), to enhance the presence try shorter
values (130...80 ms) combined with a faster 'Amp reduce' value (0.6...0.8 ms).
</p><p>
<b>Amp reduce:</b> If the maximum output level is too high, the amplification will quickly be reduced
with this speed. To minimize distortions it must not be too slow but even not too fast. Recommended
values are from 0.6 ms to 1.0 ms.
</p><p>
<b>Threshold:</b> If enabled, the enhancer tries to look ahead to reduce the amplification if the output
level would pass the adjusted value. The output level is not generally limited to the threshold. It rather
represents a 'headroom' to catch audible distortions if 'Amp reduce' does not react fast enough.
</p><p>
<b>Input HP cutoff:</b> If enabled, the compressor uses a highpass filtered (less bass) analyze signal.
This can help to reduce ugly "breathing" or "pumping" sounds of the compressor output. The result may
sound more stable and fuller. On the other hand it may create bass distortions (especially on soft scenes
with much deep bass). So a higher cutoff frequency may often require to lower the Threshold value.
</p><p>
<b>Stereo separation:</b> Enhances the channel separation on a scale up to 50% before passing the
compressor. On no extra stereo enhancement it shows "normal".
</p><p>
<b>Prelisten mode:</b> Only enabled while play. It switches to short buffers to give you a fast response
of the enhancer and equalizer settings.
</p><p>
<b>Enhancer presets:</b> Can be created by entering a name and pressing Add. Delete by selecting
a set and pressing Del. The program presets at the beginning of the list cannot be deleted.
</p><p>
<b>3 Band Equalizer:</b> Works only on 16 bit output. To reset all sliders to 0 dB press Reset. The EQ
takes some additional cpu power which can be reduced: each slider on 0 dB does not use cpu.
In the frequency fields you can set individual frequencies for the different sliders. The default
values are: 100 Hz, 1000 Hz, 10000 Hz.

<b>Continue in focused list:</b> Can be used if the paylist view is open. Means that the next track
will be taken from the current position or selection of the current/focused list. The focused list
can be slightly hilited by an option in the List settings. Without this option checked, the list focus
will be ignored and 1by1 continues playing the list where the current file was started.
</p><p>
<b>Go home before track change:</b> Returns to the folder of the current file before starting the
next track. This option prevents from playing unwanted tracks on browsing through other folders.
</p>
<h3>List options</h3>
<p>
<b>Folders and lists in file view:</b> Shows subdirectories, playlists and Cue sheets of the current
folder at the top of the file list. Useful for navigating without the folder tree.
</p><p>
<b>File info in context menu:</b> Displays audio parameters, length and ID3v1 fields of the
selected file directly at the top of the context menu.
</p><p>
<b>Show created instead of modified date:</b> Disabled by default. If enabled, the last row of the file list
shows the creation date of a file instead of the date of the last modification. For normal usage this should
be disabled. The creation date of a copied file is newer than its modified date.
This option also affects the features File finder and Easy renamer.
</p><p>
<b>Allow sort by month:</b> Gives you an additional sort option in the date row, which sorts the list
at first by month and then by year.
</p><p>
<b>Month colors:</b> This feature visualizes the date of your tracks. It associates a color range to the
12 months of the year, giving an overview of the seasons the files are dated.
</p>
<h3>Display options</h3>
<p>
<b>Show track/folder related pictures:</b> This feature shows images (e.g. cover art) in the lower left corner.
It looks for <b>two types of picture names</b> in the current directory: either a picture which <b>filename beginning</b>
fits to the current track (e.g.: <i>"album5.jpg"</i> for the tracks <i>"album5_track1.mp3", "album5_track2.mp3"</i>...)
- or, if no track related picture is found, an editable standard filename as <i>"folder.jpg"</i>. If a picture is found in an
<b>ID3v2 tag</b>, 1by1 will use it before looking for track related picture files. With <b>embedded Big title view</b>,
the picture is shown on the right and always track related or ID3v2 if present. If the image is placed below the tree view,
it shows the folder picture file of the currently browsed folder if present.
</p><p>
<b>On no present image...:</b> If the picture function does not find any picture, this option allows to fill the place
with a standard image. It must have the standard filename and must be stored in the 1by1 settings folder
(which can be reached easily by the corresponding button in the Control tab).
</p><p>
<b>Bitmap file for the toolbar buttons:</b> Lets you select an external image file for individual toolbar
styles. The BMP file must be a row of 21 images of the same size. Its color depth should be 4 or 8 bit
(16 or 256 colors). The color of the first pixel will be interpreted as the transparent color. As 1by1 saves
not the path of the BMP file, it must be in the program directory.
</p>
<h3>System options</h3>
<p>
<b>External Programs:</b> Allows starting other programs by the context menu of a selected file,
folder, playlist or Cue sheet. If you want to start an external program with <b>additional parameters</b>,
you should create a <b>batch file</b> and set it as the external program instead of the program itself.
<b>Example:</b> for calling the Lame encoder from 1by1 create a file <i>"Lame.bat"</i> containing
a line like <i>"C:\Windows\Lame.exe -m j -q 1 -b 128 %1"</i>, where %1 is the placeholder for the file
to be sent to the external program.
</p><p>
<b>High Priority:</b> Disabled by default. Only recommended if other applications interfere with 1by1
and increasing the buffer size and amount on WaveOut or the buffer time on Direct Sound does not help.
</p><p>
<b>Force portable/local settings:</b> This option creates an additional ini file in the program folder. The extra
file is needed to tell the program, where to look for the normal settings file. If the 1by1local.ini file is present,
1by1 will never write or read settings to or from the user profile (like on the command line option /localini).
The option is not usable on missing write access to the program folder.
</p>
<h3>Systray Icon</h3>
<p>
<b>Enable or disable</b> under Settings > System > Environment.
</p><p>
<b>Left mouse button</b>: Shows or hides the main window.
</p><p>
<b>Middle mouse button</b>: Stop / Resume
</p><p>
<b>Right mouse button</b>: Shows the tray menu with play and config options. The <b>Current list</b>
item shows the first 150 tracks of the current folder or playlist, sorted in the order of the window list.
</p>

<h2>Enhanced features</h2>
<h3>Big title view</h3>
<p>
1by1 can show title, track and other informations in a big text style. The Bit title view can either be
embedded in the main window - below (default) or above the lists. Or you can configure 1by1
to let the Big view appear in an extra window, optionally after an individual input idle time.
<b>Font and colors</b> can be set in the Big view settings tab. The <b>font size</b> depends on the size
of the Big view area and the number of lines (Layout). The Big title window can be switched manually from
the main/favorite menu or by the shortcut <b>Ctrl+B</b>.
</p><p>
To set up the title display, switch to the <b>Big view tab</b> in the configuration window or choose
<b>Configure...</b> from the Big view <b>context menu</b>. For adjusting the <b>window position and size</b>
drag the window and borders. If the window disappears and stays away for some reason, you can
restore the default position with the <b>Reset view position</b> button in the settings.
</p><p>
<b>Extra infos:</b> If activated, the title display frequently shows some additional pages
about program and play settings or track and output parameters. How long a page is shown, can
be set in the <b>Speed/Info cycle time</b> field.
</p><p>
<b>Info pattern:</b> The occurance of the info pages can be individually
adjusted here. The <b>?</b> button shows the meaning of possible letters -
while the help window is open, you can work in the program.
</p><p>
<b>RSS feed titles:</b> You can enrich title and track informations with news headlines or any other
RSS provided information. 1by1 can frequently download RSS files and show their titles.
Enter one or more RSS sources into the URLs field - separated by a space character.
If you are connected to the Internet via proxy, you can enter a proxy address in the system tab.
To read more than the titles you can show the complete RSS download set with <b>View RSS file</b>
from the Big view context menu (right button).
</p><p>
<b>Update after (min)</b> lets you adjust in minutes how often 1by1 shall try to get a new version.
The RSS feed file content will be ignored if it is older than the amount of hours set under
<b>Skip if older</b> - or shown always if that entry is 0.
</p><p>
Under <b>Idle seconds until popup</b> or in the Big view context menu you can set,
how many seconds with no keyboard or mouse activity should pass until the Big view
apears automatically. The auto popup works only if 1by1 is the foreground window.
</p>
<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>
The log file stores informations about played tracks. You can view the content
by calling <b>View track log</b> from the main menu. The log file is needed
for retrying scrobbling if a connection error has occured. If a title has been scrobbled successfully,
the last column in the log view shows 'done'. If the transfer failed, it shows 'tried'. You can also use
the track log to browse played tracks and restart them by double clicking or call other functions with
the right mouse button.
</p><p>
<b>Scrobbling</b> has been disabled in 1.86 since last.fm changed the track info submission protocol to
"API 2.0" where authentication by API key is needed. Receiving an API key for 1by1 was not working
due to relaunch problems of the last.fm site.
</p>
<h3>WAV file conversion</h3>
<p>
Tracks to be decoded by ACM, mpglib or BASS can also be saved to uncompressed WAV files (16 bit).
The function can be found in the track context menu if 1by1 is not playing anything.
In the dialog you can adjust name and location of the destination file. You also can apply
audio processing with the current settings for enhancer, equalizer and mono downmix.
</p>
<h3>HTTP web and streaming server</h3>
<p>
The HTTP server feature allows to control 1by1 by a simple remote web interface. The streaming server sends
the audio output of 1by1 in a configurable MP3 format to connected receivers.
</p><p>
To enable the HTTP server, enter the <b>local IP address of the computer</b> which runs 1by1 into the
<b>Server address</b> field. Usually you can use the local address shown on the right in the dialog (while the
server is not running). Also the port number is needed, for HTTP this usually is 80 or 8080. See the example string
in the config window on the right. After enabling/starting the server, the <b>Firewall</b> of your system may ask for
permission. You need either to allow 1by1 or the port used. With the entered server <i>address:port</i>
of the above field you can access the simple web interface from any browser in the (local) network.
</p><p>
The MP3 <b>streaming URL</b> has the format <i>http://your-ip:port/1by1.mp3</i>. Give this URL to your remote player
device. You can also use an M3U playlist. Both can be found on bottom of the web interface page. Streaming starts
if 1by1 is playing and a client requests the MP3 URL. If 1by1 is not playing and a client starts streaming, 1by1
should automatically resume the current track.
</p><p>
While not streaming, you can adjust the encoder settings
and select the encoder. Note that Lame's lame_enc.dll must be in the path or in the 1by1 program folder. For
ACM the "professional" version (l3codecp) should be used. Newer Windows versions should have it already,
but it may be needed to activate by adding a few Registry entries.
</p><p>
The option <b>Keep connection and send silence</b> allows streaming even if 1by1 is not playing. This may also be
needed if Gapless play is not used. Otherwise an interruption of the stream may occur on track changes.
</p>
</p><p class="note">
<b>Note:</b> Streaming of a running audio output is a quite complex matter of moving, handling, compressing
and sending audio segments. Stream terminations, sound interruptions or skippings may occur.
Depending on the device, WaveOut method for local audio output might
give a little more stable results than DirectSound.

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<p><b>How can I play WAV, OGG, FLAC, ... or CD tracks?</b><br>
By using the BASS library or a plugin. More infos under <a href="#aud">Audio config</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Which plugin must I use to play format XYZ (e.g. RAM/RA, WMA...)?</b><br>
I don't know. Not all plugins and file types are tested. Known informations about
the plugin behaviour are collected in the Plugin section (<a href="#aud">Configuration</a>)
of this manual.
</p>
<p><b>1by1 hangs when seeking OGG files</b><br>
This problem occurs with the input plugin "in_vorbis.dll". Workaround: Call the plugin's configuration
under <i>Settings - Decoder</i>. Select the plugin and press the <i>Settings</i> button. Set the
"Priority" slider to "normal" or lower (it's on "highest" by default) - Thanks oneflyfish and 7Orfeo7!
</p>
<p><b>The volume fader does not work or affects other programs</b><br>
Activate 1by1's internal volume adjustment: Settings - Audio - Options - Alt. volume setting.
</p>
<p><b>When using 1by1 in background, there are sound interruptions</b><br>
In the Audio settings switch to a Direct Sound output device (usually to the first list item
beginning with "DirectSound:") or check "High task priority" in the System settings tab.
</p>
<p><b>Why doesn't 1by1 show ID3 Tag informations in the list?</b><br>
Because every file would have to be scanned - and reading folder contents would
be much slower. But you can 1by1 set to show scannable informations
as artist and title in an extra info column which can be enabled in the settings.
ID3 fields are also shown in the track info dialog (Context menu or Alt+Return or Ctrl+I)
and in the Big title view.
</p>
<p><b>How can I shuffle multiple folders at once?</b><br>
Random play is only possible for the current list. But you can fill the list with
the whole content including sufolders by using the function <i>Show
subfolder contents</i> in the tree context menu. (It runs the <a href="#lis">File Finder</a>
with an empty search string.)
The resulting list can be shuffled or sorted by name, path, date or size.
</p>
<p><b>The network or desktop folders do not work correctly</b><br>
The complete network structure is only shown on directly browsing the network. To display an
existing track path in the network, 1by1 will add the single <i>\\server\sharepoint\</i> part under the
network item. Virtual folders are successfully tested under Windows 95, 98, XP and Linux/Wine.
</p>
<p><b>What is a command line parameter and how do I use such a thing?</b><br>
Command line parameters can be set for example in the properties of a program shortcut -
which is one of the most usual cases. For usage details, please, refer some documentation
of your operating system.
</p>
<p><b>Can 1by1 support multiple languages?</b><br>
No. Language support is not planned. The program and all documentations will only
be provided in english.
</p>
<p><b>How can I make 1by1 portable</b><br>
Easiest and most stable way is by the "Force portable/local settings" option under
Settings > System > "Configuration files". But even without this switch 1by1 is
already portable if: 1. the program folder has write access for the ini,
2. there is no 1by1 folder in the user profile. 1by1 will only store the settings in the user
profile if it hasn't write access to its own folder.
But once the settings are in the user profile, 1by1 uses this location first.
Another way to force portable usage is the /localini command line option.
To prevent 1by1 from starting in the last folder, check "Start in Base folder" and "Clear Base folder"
in the tree context menu.
</p>
<p><b>1by1 starts, but I can't see the window!</b><br>
This may only happen in rare cases, e.g. if 1by1 was portably used in a multi monitor system, and is being started on another computer with a smaller desktop. To reset the position of the windows, do this: Go to the program data folder - either the program folder itself or the folder "1by1" in the user profile (Application Data / Roaming - may be hidden). Open the file 1by1.ini (usually by double clicking). Delete these lines: "window_x=.. / window_y=.. / compact_x=.. / compact_y=.." and save the ini file back.
</p>
<p><b>1by1 starts slowly</b><br>
If your computer has still a floppy drive, make sure to check this: Settings > System > Hide system folders > Drive A: (checked by default since 1.73). Using many plugins may also slow down the start.
</p>
<p><b>1by1 crashs/hangs when starting a track</b><br>
This can happen in rare cases if the mp3 has an IDv2 tag with attached image. There are tags with corrupted image data which 1by1 unfortunately can't handle. Settings > Display > Cover art > "Ignore ID3v2 attached images" should avoid the problem. Another way is correcting the image by re-saving it with an up-to-date ID3 editor.
